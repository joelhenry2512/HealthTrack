# Script for Project Overview Slide

## Slide: Project Overview

**Bullet Points on Slide:**
- Track daily health metrics (weight, steps, calories, exercise, sleep, water)
- Set and manage fitness goals with automatic progress calculation
- Integrate with third-party apps (Strava, Fitbit, Lose It)
- View progress through interactive cards and dashboards
- Manage goal lifecycle (create, pause, resume, complete)

## SCRIPT OPTIONS:

### Version 1: Concise (30-45 seconds)

"HealthTrack is a comprehensive fitness and health tracking application that helps users monitor their wellness journey in one unified platform.

Users can track daily health metrics including weight, steps, calories burned, exercise minutes, sleep duration, and water intake. The app allows them to set personalized fitness goals with automatic progress calculation, so they always know how close they are to achieving their targets.

One of our key features is integration with popular third-party apps like Strava, Fitbit, and Lose It. This means users can automatically sync their data instead of manual entry - which is where my contribution comes in, as I built these integrations.

Users view their progress through interactive dashboards and cards, and they have complete control over their goals - they can create new goals, pause them when needed, resume later, and mark them complete when achieved.

Now let me walk you through my specific contribution to this project..."

### Version 2: Detailed (45-60 seconds)

"Let me start by giving you an overview of HealthTrack and what problem we're solving.

HealthTrack is a comprehensive health and fitness tracking application designed to help users manage their wellness journey in one centralized platform. The problem we identified is that people often use multiple apps - maybe Strava for running, Fitbit for steps, a separate app for calorie tracking - and they don't have a unified view of their overall health.

Our solution provides several key features. First, users can track all their daily health metrics in one place - weight, steps, calories burned, exercise minutes, sleep duration, and water intake.

Second, the app includes a goal management system where users can set personalized fitness goals - like 'run 50 miles this month' or 'lose 10 pounds' - and the system automatically calculates their progress toward those goals.

Third, and this is particularly relevant to my contribution, we integrate with popular third-party applications like Strava, Fitbit, and Lose It. This means users don't have to manually enter their data every day. If they go for a run tracked by Strava, that data automatically appears in HealthTrack. I'll be diving deep into how I built these integrations in just a moment.

Users interact with their data through intuitive dashboards and interactive cards that visualize their progress. And they have full control over their goal lifecycle - they can create goals, pause them if life gets busy, resume when ready, and mark them complete when achieved.

My specific contribution focused on two critical systems that make this all possible..."

### Version 3: Problem-Solution Format (45 seconds)

"HealthTrack solves a common problem many fitness enthusiasts face: data fragmentation across multiple apps and platforms.

Think about it - you might use Strava for cycling, Fitbit for daily steps, another app for calorie tracking, and you're manually logging weight somewhere else. It's messy, time-consuming, and you never get a complete picture of your health.

HealthTrack brings everything together. Users can track six key health metrics daily: weight, steps, calories, exercise, sleep, and water intake. They can set smart fitness goals that automatically track progress based on their actual data.

But here's what makes it powerful - and this is where my contribution comes in - we integrate directly with Strava, Fitbit, and Lose It. Your morning run on Strava? It automatically syncs. Your Fitbit counted 10,000 steps? That data flows right in. No manual entry required.

Users see everything in one beautiful dashboard with interactive cards and charts. They can create goals, pause them when life gets hectic, resume when ready, and celebrate when they complete them.

Now let me show you how I made the integrations and authentication work..."

### Version 4: User Journey Format (50 seconds)

"Let me walk you through what HealthTrack does from a user's perspective.

Imagine you're someone who wants to get healthier. You sign up for HealthTrack and immediately set a goal - maybe 'Exercise 150 minutes per week' or 'Lose 10 pounds by summer.'

Every day, you can manually log your health metrics - weight, steps, calories, exercise minutes, sleep duration, water intake. But that's tedious, right?

This is where the magic happens. You connect your Strava account - which I implemented - and now every time you go for a run or bike ride, that data automatically appears in HealthTrack. You connect your Fitbit, and your steps, sleep, and heart rate sync automatically. No manual work needed.

The dashboard shows your progress in real-time through interactive cards and visualizations. You can see you're at 120 out of 150 minutes of exercise this week. You're 70% toward your weight loss goal.

Life gets busy? Pause your goal. Ready to restart? Resume it. Crushed your target? Mark it complete and set a new one.

My role in this project was building the authentication system that keeps accounts secure and the integration system that makes this automatic data sync possible. Let me show you how I did it..."

### Version 5: Feature Highlight Format (40 seconds)

"HealthTrack is our team's comprehensive health and fitness tracking platform with five core features.

Feature one: Comprehensive health tracking. Users monitor six key daily metrics - weight, steps, calories burned, exercise minutes, sleep duration, and water intake - all in one place.

Feature two: Smart goal management. Users set fitness goals and the system automatically calculates progress based on their actual data. No spreadsheets, no manual math.

Feature three: Third-party integrations - and this is my primary contribution. We connect with Strava for activities, Fitbit for comprehensive health data, and Lose It for nutrition tracking. Data syncs automatically through OAuth 2.0 flows that I implemented.

Feature four: Interactive dashboards. Users visualize their progress through dynamic cards and charts that update in real-time.

Feature five: Complete goal lifecycle management. Create, pause, resume, and complete goals as your life and priorities change.

My specific work focused on features three and the authentication behind it all..."

## TIMING NOTES:

- **30-45 seconds:** Use Version 1 (Concise)
- **45-60 seconds:** Use Version 2 (Detailed) or Version 4 (User Journey)
- **Under 30 seconds:** Cut to key points only
- **If time permits:** Add a stat like "Users can track 6 metrics from 3 providers"

---
